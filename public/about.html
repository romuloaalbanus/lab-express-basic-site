      Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956)[16] is the main Protagonist of The
      Simpsons series. He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart
      Simpson, Lisa Simpson, and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be
      ~240 pounds), lazy, and often ignorant to the world around him. Although
      Homer has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love, and even
      bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. He
      serves as the main protagonist of the 2007 film adaptation.
