      In most episodes, he works as the nuclear safety inspector at the
      Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position which, whilst being wholly
      unsuitable for, he has held since "Homer's Odyssey", the third episode of
      the series. At the nuclear plant, Homer is often ignored and completely
      forgotten by his boss Mr. Burns, and he constantly falls asleep and
      neglects his duties. Matt Groening has stated that he decided to have
      Homer work at the power plant because of the potential for Homer to wreak
      severe havoc. Each of his other jobs has lasted only one episode. In the
      first half of the series, the writers developed an explanation about how
      he got fired from the plant and was then rehired in every episode. In
      later episodes, he often began a new job on impulse, without any mention
      of his regular employment.
